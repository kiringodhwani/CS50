**Assignments from Week 4 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python at Harvard**

Week 4 was spent learning about **Libraries, Command Line Arguments, APIs, and Modules**. Below are descriptions of each of the programs in this folder:  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1. **professor.py**: 
   - Prompts the user for a level (either 1, 2, or 3). If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program prompts again.
   - Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with  digits.
   - Prompts the user to solve each of these problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program outputs EEE and prompts the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program outputs the correct answer.
   - Ultimately outputs the user’s score, a number out of 10.

6. **emojize.py**: Prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji. Uses the built-in emoji module.
