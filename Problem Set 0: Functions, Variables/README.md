**Assignments from Week 0 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python at Harvard**
Week 1 was spent learning about **Functions** and **Variables**

Below are descriptions of each of the programs in this folder:
1. **indoor.py**: Prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace are outputted unchanged. 
2. **playback.py**: Prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
3. **faces.py**: Prompts the user for input, accepts a str as input, and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 and any :( converted to 🙁. All other text are returned unchanged.
4. **einstein.py**: Prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer. Uses the equation E = mc^2, wherein E represents energy (measured in Joules), m represents mass (measured in kilograms), and  c represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second).
5. **tip.py**: Prompts the user for the price of their meal and then outputs how much they should tip in dollars and cents based on a 15% tip rate.
