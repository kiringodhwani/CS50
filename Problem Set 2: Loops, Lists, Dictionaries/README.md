**Assignments from Week 2 of CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python at Harvard**

Week 2 was spent learning about **Loops (for and while), Lists, and Dictionaries**. Below are descriptions of each of the programs in this folder:

1. **plates.py**: Prompts the user for a vanity plate and then outputs: 
- Valid if the plate meets all of the requirements of a vanity plate or Invalid if it does not meet all of the requirements.
2. **camel.py**: Prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assumes that the user’s input will be in camel case. Camel case example = preferredFirstName, snake case example = preferred_first_name.
3. **coke.py**: Prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, outputs how many cents in change the user is owed. Assumes that the user will only input integers, and ignores any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination (25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents).
4. **twttr.py**: Prompts the user for a string of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
